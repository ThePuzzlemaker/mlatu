I make announcements, discuss the languaage, and am available to answer questions on [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/qNQV6nnAZj).

## Miscellany

"Mlatu" is the Lojban word for "cat", referencing [Cat](https://github.com/cdiggins/cat-language) by Christopher Diggins, [Kitten](https://kittenlang.org/) by Jon Purdy, and the fact that Mlatu is a con*cat*enative programming language.

"Mlatu" is pronounced "melatoo", as best as I can tell.

The source is based with gratitude off of [the source of Kitten](https://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten) by Jon Purdy.
