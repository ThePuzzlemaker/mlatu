## Contributing to the code or prelude 

After following the Installation instructions on the Readme, there's little else you need to get started. Simply make the changes and then run `esy b dune exec bin/main.exe` to start and test the REPL and prelude without re-installing completely.

## Contributing to the translation effort

To update or add new translations, it is recommended to use a translation toolkit like POEdit. After making changes, simply run `make` in the `po` directory to update the downstream dependencies.
