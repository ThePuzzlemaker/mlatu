Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

After following the Installation instructions on the Readme, there's little else you need to get started. Simply make the changes and then run `esy b dune exec bin/main.exe` to start and test the REPL and prelude without re-installing completely.
